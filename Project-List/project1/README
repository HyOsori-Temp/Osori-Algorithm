<Project 1 : Sorting>

This project is to implement various kind of sorting algorithms
and see the different time complexity among those algorithms. 

Implement insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort and count sort
and check the execution time for each sorting program.

- Test generator is provided 
Compile : make
Execute : ./test_generator <filename> <size>

Program "test_generator" generates the random test files.
Test files would have random numbers unordered.
You can generates test files by the size as you want.
